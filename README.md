# ClipboardImage
Allows you to right click in any directory to save the image in your clipboard to a .bmp file.
On non-Windows systems, however, the only thing that works is save_clipboard.py

## Installation

  2. Download as a zip
  3. Extract zip to C:\
  4. Double-click on ClipboardImage.reg
  5. Open run

## Nerd Info
You can save an image from the clipboard using the included python script.

Syntax: `save_clipboard.py <output_file>`
